## v0.1.3 (not released yet)
* Honor full-level when clicking pads with the mouse

## v0.1.2
* Fix Erase screen crashes and cosmetic issues

## v0.1.1

* FXedit screen doesn't crash (the screen is still useless because there is no EB16 emulation)
* WAV-files that have non-data chunks will now quick-preview correctly
* No more crash after visiting the Metronome Sound screen

## v.0.1.0
* Initial versioned release
* Version number displayed in top right
* Fixed INSERT SOUND > SECTION START
* Switch between VMPC and ORIGINAL pad mapping in Shift + 0 screen

VMPC pad mapping is notes 35 to 98 in ascending order, making it much easier to control vMPC2000XL with a pad or keyboard controller. ORIGINAL is the original wacky mapping.
